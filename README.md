# Wave_Data_Correction_Tool

A tool that collects Surfline data daily & stores it into an SQL Db. 

Functions to create the initial DB, insert into DB, and scrape Surfline are in the folder scripts.py. The remaining files are all related to the .NET MVC Core application, which allows users to manually edit data from a web application.
